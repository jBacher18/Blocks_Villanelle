1. Read through the Villanelle User Guide
2. Run the Villanelle app
3. Perform the following tasks:

        Task 1 (open file examples/tasks/1_task_helloworld.yml):
            This is a simple "Hello World" example where we have an agent named as "World". We have specified the interaction with this agent in the "User Interaction" property, where we define a user action that sets sayHello to true. The "World" agent responds back based on this variable. You would be required to do the following:

            1. Create a goodbye action which will provide the user with a "Say goodbye" choice. Test it out.
            2. Add a goodbye response to the World agent which will make it respond appropriately to the goodbye action. It might not work as expected after you add the response.
            3. Fix the effects of both the hello and goodbye response of the world such that you get the desired behavior.

        Task 2 (open file examples/tasks/2_task_shopkeeper.yml):
            This is an example where you are trying to buy a sword from a shopkeeper. You do not have enough gold and hence you have to earn gold before asking for the sword.
            1. Test out the game. It does not quite play out as expected. Asking for the sword does nothing. Earning gold immediately gives you the sword. Have a look at the Shopkeeper's behavior tree on the right panel to get a sense of what is wrong.
            2. This requires a minor fix to the Shopkeeper's code. Remember, there are two control structures in Villanelle: sequence and selector. After you have made the changes, play the game again and check out the difference in the tree of the Shopkeeper.

4. Fill out the survey at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWCJz-bXVUVxyfNv7AeudzqskdUR5yUzI8PWPLomglnBWFtw/viewform?usp=sf_link
