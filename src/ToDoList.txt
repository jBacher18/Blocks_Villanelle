TO DO LIST (For Blockly Villanelle):
Last thing I did: Linked up the generator functions (just copied them into a function in app.tsx which is getting tooo big)

TO DO Tonight:
 (DONE) Fix Saving
 + Add Math
 + Reorganize the Boxes in the toolbox
 + Check: Each Block
 (Done) Change: Tab Switching from 2 of the same to alternate sides (Also I kinda want 3 pane, which may require some finagling)
 + See if I can do dynamic size styling
 
KNOWN BUGS (not fixing):
 + You can definitely attach blocks improperly -> Somewhat, certain things work right, but other things, not so much (this might be fixable)
 + 


Note: 11/12/20
There seem to be a lot of generator problems, but generally:
No New line after effects in conditions (also the two condition subblocks getting dashes when they're not supposed to, and not be properly aligned)

Bug (Error? Problems) Fixes:
 + IMPORTANT: Add the fix that makes it so each block has the proper legal subblocks
 + Seems like free floating blocks get code generated at end. Wonder if I can turn that off, or just fix that somehow
 + REMOVE SPACE IN VARIABLE NAMES (Somehow)
 + Weird stuff when switch from Blocks to anything else

Things to do:
 + Fix File saving to save both an XML and a YAML File
 + Fix File loading to take either an XML or YAML 
 + Add checkbox to disable automatic Blocks -> code (Maybe then also add button to generate?)

 + IMPORTANT: Devise (and check) a list of tests to determine all the generation of code is working properly
 + minor: Split out functions in App TSX (readability, etc)
 
 + More later, probably
